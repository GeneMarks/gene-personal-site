## Bloat
Bloat is real, bloat is fake.\
A giraffe has four ~~stomachs~~ ~~compartments~~.

Bloat is palpable, bloat is abstract.\
A 64 KB binary ~~is~~ ~~not~~ bloat.

01000010 01101100 01101111 01100001 01110100\
is ~~more~~ ~~less~~ than\
42 6C 6F 61 74.

Bloat is unbearable, bloat is liberating.\
This ~~is~~ ~~not~~ bloat.
